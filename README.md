I've created an NBA matching memory game. Created with css, HTML, and js, the object of the game is to match two cards of the same team until every team has been paired.

## (Features)
## Current features:
-Ability to reset the game by refreshing the page. You are only allowed to click two cards at a time until they either reset as a result of being incorrect, or match up.
## Future features:
-Include timer and "star rating" system depending on how fast you can match the cards.
(Technologies Used)
## -HTML: used to display the overall frame of the game.
## -CSS: used to manipulate the colors, aspect ratio, and responsive design for the game.
## -JS: used to create the functionality of the game, such as flipping the cards, checking to see if they are a correct match, and to insert smaller functionalities like a limited-card-flip system to stop the game from crashing.

## (Testing)
- numerous testing has been implemented to make sure that the game does function properly. In terms of the overall game, the game was played after each step was written in JS to ensure its playability. ie, at the start, I inserted a timer on each card flip to give the player enough time to see if they matched. If they were not a successful match, the card would have a 1-second delay to flip back over before allowing the player to select another pair. This ensured that the game would not bug other cards from flipping back over due to an incorrect pairing.
- Inspector was also used to verify the proper console.log functionality, as well as testing the responsiveness of each breakpoint.
